> Hello Team,

> First we are on a race against time. BusinessDay just beat us to it with its recent report.  We need to wow our subscribers and give them a reason to keep paying for our online publications.  As a result I am commissioning the Research group and our recent hires - the data science team to provide a detailed report that we need to deliver to our subscribers in 3 weeks.  I have titled the report **NSE 2016 - 2020:Lost Opportunities Report**
> 
> The report should answer the following question and be an excellent read for your subscribers. We would also want to provide an interactive report that our subscribers can directly interact with and test their own assumptions.
>
> - How did every stock perform during the period?
> - What was the performance per sector?
> - What were the top gainers and the top loosers?
> - What were the most traded stock in terms on volume, and value?
> - What would happen if I invested 500,000
> - Is there a daily, weekly or monthly pattern for each company, each sector?
> - Can you answer the question which sectors would do well in 2021 - monthly, quarterly, and end of year.?
> - What is the general trend in the market - per company and per sector
> - Can you check how external data influence the stock price performance?
>   - does the companies financial year end influence their stock price performance
>   - what other external data do you think can be helpful
>     - foreign exchange rate (CBN rates, Black market rate)
>
> 
> Already I have informed the marketing team to commence marketing this report on online platforms to prepare our subscribers for the big report.
